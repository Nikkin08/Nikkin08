### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

A passionate and driven student with a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. My work focuses on building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. With a strong foundation in **Python** and other programming languages, I am constantly exploring and implementing advanced concepts in areas like **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Currently, I'm dedicating my efforts to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, aiming to create robust and efficient knowledge-based systems. I'm always eager to learn, collaborate on innovative projects, and contribute to the rapidly evolving AI landscape.
